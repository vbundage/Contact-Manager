# Contact Manager
A contact manager application to manage user contacts. This app was made as a 
practice take home project during the Launch School curriculum. The app is made
to mitigate the amount of HTTP requests by storing contacts in-memory for non-changes.
HTTP requests are sent to get the contacts initially and when making updates to
contacts.

## Requirements
Back-end code was provided for setting up the web server and handling API requests. The aim of the
project is to build the front-end while using the API to manage contacts. 

## Built With
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - API and web server
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - Template Engine
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons
